Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said.

    "The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said the scheme will be rolled out across the country over the coming year. Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist at University College London specialising in antibiotic resistance, told the BBC it was \"quite an innovative step\".",

The unpopular poll tax, which replaced the rates system, was introduced by the Conservative Thatcher government in Scotland in 1989 before the rest of the country, sparking protests on the streets.

Therese Coffey MP said she expected design options to be finalised \"by the end of June\". Survey work found the main cause of Mytholmroyd's river flooding was narrow sections and low bridges. The EA plans to replace bridges and raise flood walls. Construction work is expected to last two years with homes and businesses near Caldene Bridge purchased for \"fair market rates\". Adrian Gill, of the EA, said: \"Some houses were damaged beyond repair by the 2015 floods but all were purchased by agreement with the owners. \"For many",

    "The work by think tank dpart found lowering the voting age could increase youngster's engagement with politics. It also found schools had more influence than parents in giving confidence in understanding politics. Those aged 16 and 17 were able to vote in the referendum on 18 September, the first UK ballot to include them. Researchers at dpart gathered evidence from two surveys of under 18s - one conducted in April and May 2013, and then a second conducted one year later. More than 1,000 young people responded to each survey. They found under 18s were at least as interested in politics as adults. Only 7% had never talked about the referendum with anyone. Young people were less likely than adults to align themselves with political parties, but the proportion who said they did not feel an affinity to one dropped in the year before the vote, from 57% to 51%. Parents had a strong influence",

Mr Clarke discovered that some automated menus have nearly 80 options. It can take over four minutes to get to the service required if the caller listens to each stage in full, he said. As an example, speaking to an adviser at HM Revenue and Customs only required pressing four buttons but it could take six minutes to get through each menu level, Mr Clarke said.

Mr Brazier, in a speech to the University of Liverpool's Institute for Risk and Uncertainty, added that this increase in debt was \"dangerous to borrowers, lenders and, most importantly from our perspective, everyone else in the economy\". He warned that High Street banks were at risk of entering \"a spiral of complacency\" about mounting consumer debt levels. \"Lending standards can go from responsible to reckless very quickly. \"The sorry fact is that as lenders think the risks they face are falling, the risks they - and the wider economy face - are actually growing,\" Mr Brazier added.

The team at Harvard Medical School said the unintended effect was \"disturbing\". Experts said similar changes had been seen in other countries. In 2003, there were concerns about an increased suicide risk from some antidepressants. It led to the US Food and Drug Administration changing the medicine warnings and widespread media reports. However, there was concern that the reports were exaggerated and missed out the benefits of antidepressants. The study, which followed 2.5 million teenagers and young adults between 2000 and 2010, showed an immediate impact of the warnings. Prescriptions fell by a third in teenagers and by a quarter in young adults. The number of suicide attempts increased by 22% in teenagers and 34% in young adults. Overall it led to an additional 77 attempts, the researchers estimated. The report concluded: \"It is disturbing that after the health advisories, warnings and media",

Tata looked to sell its UK business, but paused the process in July.

Mr Jha also said he expects the UK government to keep a promise of helping to solve the company's pension problems. However, he warned: \"We must remember that whether you drown one foot under the water or ten foot under the water, you still drown.\" A \u00c2\u00a3485m pension deficit was given as a reason for some potential buyers being put off.

The hotel is located on the Croisette promenade - one of the most prestigious locations in the town. The theft is the largest in a series of high-profile robberies in Cannes, which is famous for its annual film festival. The Carlton Hotel is where Alfred Hitchcock filmed To Catch A Thief - his 1955 film about a jewel thief operating in the French Riviera. During the latest theft, an exhibition of diamonds by the jeweller Leviev was being held in the lobby of the hotel. Local media said the robber made off with the jewels in a briefcase.

Combined with other plant techniques, the team created drops that grew larger as temperatures increased. The authors say the development could significantly improve water harvesting and electricity generation. A little drop of water may seem insignificant but the physical processes involved in both the formation and movement of the liquid are essential to operation of thermal power plants, desalination and air conditioning systems. Condensation is also critical to the more fundamental function of gathering water for human use in dry climates, a growing, global issue. Researchers have made previous attempts to mimic the remarkable abilities of the Namib beetle, which uses its bumpy shell to draw all the water it needs from periodic, foggy winds in the desert. The assumption until now has been that the surface chemistry of the beetle's back has been the key - but this new study says that",

Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: \"Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this. \"It is important that we understand how social media use relates to these.

    "About 4,000 support workers were moved to Entrust, a firm jointly run by Capita and the county council, in 2013. After inspecting 18 schools, Ofsted said it had \"significant concerns\" about the company and its relationship with teachers and governors. The council said there had been issues with Entrust but it was improving. Entrust delivers much of the training and consultancy work in schools across the county. The staff transferred to the firm in 2013 included classroom support staff, school cooks, cleaners and caretakers. Ofsted carried out the inspections at 18 schools to see how effective Entrust was in supporting and raising classroom standards.

Banjong Pongphon is mayor of Padang Besar, a sub-district in southern Songkhla province where 26 bodies were exhumed from mass graves last week. Smugglers' camps in the forests and plantations surrounding Padang Besar are among the main destinations of the migrants, according to a report by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It is not yet clear what those exhumed from the graves discovered in Songkhla died from. The UNHCR report said that over half of",
    "Media playback is not supported on this device The Jester from Leicester had not lost a frame in his opening two matches at the York Barbican. But Selby, 32, was off his best against world number 33 in the third round and was never in front until clinching victory with a fine break of 67. \"I was just scraping through. I don't know how I won the game,\" Selby said. \"I thought sooner or later I would come out and start performing, but it didn't seem to happen.\" Selby, famously described as a \"torturer\" by Ronnie O'Sullivan for his ability to grind out wins when not at his best, trailed 2-0, 3-2, 4-3 and 5-4, but showed all his renowned battling ability to pull through at the York Barbican. \"Jamie deserved to win the match,\" Selby admitted. \"He played great, scored two centuries and made more breaks. Every time he got chances he seemed to win the frame, in one visit, if not",
    "A 22-year-old from Sleaford and a 25-year-old from Bracknell were detained by police on Thursday. It is believed that the men were involved in repeated attempts to infiltrate the Microsoft network between January and March this year. Both were charged under the UK's Computer Misuse Act that criminalises unauthorised access to computers. Police said the pair were part of a larger group that was plotting the cyber-intrusion into the software giant's systems, seeking to steal customer data. Detectives from the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (Serocu) carried out the raids which, said Det Sgt Rob Bryant, also led it to seize devices believed to have",

Domino's said the positive figures were a result of \"organic growth\". It claimed it had defied the current global economic environment. On Wednesday, the pizza giant also announced its second profit upgrade since December - sending its shares up more than 10%. Domino's Australia is listed in Sydney and formally called Domino's Pizza Enterprises. It holds the master franchise rights to the Domino's brand in Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Japan and The Netherlands.

    "The \"loneliness maps\" could be used to target limited resources at the people and places that need them most. The Hidden Citizens report, published by the Campaign to End Loneliness, said this has already been done successfully in Gloucestershire and Essex. Studies have suggested loneliness contributes to health problems. Laura Alcock-Ferguson, director for the Campaign to End Loneliness, said: \"If local councils and services do not act now to find the people experiencing severe loneliness, we are likely to see the consequences in our hospitals and social care services. \"Loneliness and isolation in older age is a serious public health issue and increases the risk of conditions including dementia, high blood pressure and depression.\" The report, published in conjunction with the University of Kent, describes how Gloucestershire County Council adapted a model used by Essex County Council when creating its own loneliness map. The map was created using existing data about people",
    "A court filing on Friday had included the property among a list of assets that could be sold. But the Bremer Trust issued a statement on Saturday saying it \"has no plans\" to offload Paisley Park. It added that the \"Purple Rain house\" - which featured in the career-making film of the same name - was also safe. Prince was found dead in an elevator inside Paisley Park in April, after an accidental overdose of painkillers. Thousands of fans gathered outside the property in the following days to lay tributes and pay their respects. There have been calls for the studios and soundstages to be opened to the public, in the style of Elvis's former home, Graceland.

A taxi driver has confessed to his murder, but local police now believe he was not working alone, Sanjoy Majumder, BBC India Correspondent said. Mr Power's family said they want to find out the truth. They said they are struggling for information from the Foreign Office and other officials in India. \"I keep asking them questions, but I don't seem to be getting any answers... even today I'm pleading.. asking for information from the Foreign Office,\" Ranjit's brother, Amrik Singh Power, said.

    "Keeping older people at work can also boost wages for younger employees, argues Ros Altmann, the government-appointed champion for older workers. Her report suggests that extending working lives would add \u00c2\u00a355bn a year to the UK economy. If everyone worked one year longer, it would add 1% to annual GDP, she says. \"Academic and historical evidence shows that, far from damaging job prospects, keeping more older people in work is associated with rising employment and wages for younger people,\" said Dr Altmann, a former adviser to 10 Downing Street. If older people keep working, the theory goes, they have more money to spend, and that boosts the economy, creating more jobs for everyone. Conversely, if older people stop work, there is less money in the economy, so fewer jobs. The idea is well-known to economists as the \"lump of labour fallacy\" - the false belief that the number of jobs in an economy is fixed. If the number of over-50s leaving the workforce continues",

East Lothian Council has announced it will increase its council tax by 3% for the first time since 2008-09. It means the average Band D household will pay an additional 65p per week. The council tax in West Lothian has been frozen for bands A to D, with the tax for Band D remaining at \u00c2\u00a31,128. Bills for properties in Bands E to H will rise automatically from April through national changes to the way council tax is calculated which have been made by the Scottish government.

    "The Youth Offending Board says there is a shortage of places in London and the South East. It plans to build new accommodation and education blocks at Cookham Wood, taking its capacity from 131 to 208. Andrew Neilson from the Howard League said the centre had major problems and it should be managing those rather than creating the capacity for more issues. He said: \"A 15 year-old took his own life in the prison. \"There are a succession of inspection reports which have said that this is a prison with which has had major problems. \"There are reports of widespread bullying, physical assault and we don't think it's appropriate to be expanding a prison which has these kind of problems.\"",
    "Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls in April 2014, but freed 21 of them in October after negotiations with the Red Cross. The freed girls have been in government custody since their release but were brought home to Chibok for Christmas. But family members told the BBC that the girls were kept in a politician's house and barred from going home. They were also prevented from attending church services with their families. The girls were take to the house of an assembly member in Chibok to be reunited with their parents but weren't allowed to go to their own homes. \"I can't believe my daughter has come this close to home but can't come home,\" said one father. \"There's no point bringing them to Chibok only to be locked in another prison. They couldn't even go to church on Christmas Day.\" Another said a soldier had confiscated his phone when he tried to take a picture of his daughter. He said: \"I snapped picture of myself and my daughter but the security guys came",
    "The bank says its phone and mobile banking customers will no longer have to remember a password or memorable places and dates to access accounts. Barclays has already introduced voice recognition software, but it is only available to certain clients. RBS and NatWest have offered finger print technology for the last year. The move comes weeks ahead of the launch of Atom Bank, which will allow its customers to log on via a face recognition system. HSBC says its service will be offered to up to 15 million banking customers. First Direct's customers will be offered the voice and fingerprint recognition system over the next few weeks, followed by HSBC's in the summer. Francesca McDonagh, HSBC UK's head of retail banking and wealth management, described the change as \"the largest planned rollout of voice biometric security technology in the UK\". She said: \"The launch of voice and touch ID makes it even quicker and easier for customers to access their bank account, using",
    "The bill aims to revoke parts of the UK government's 2016 Trade Union Act. It would mean current restrictions on industrial action in the NHS, the fire service, schools and other devolved services in Wales would change. UK ministers say industrial relations are a matter for Westminster. A key element of the UK government's law is to only allow strikes backed by 40% of a union's members in a ballot. But members of the Welsh Assembly's Equality, Local Government and Communities Committee agreed the new legislation was needed to maintain Wales' \"social-partnership\" approach. In March, Welsh Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said it would be a \"democratic outrage\" if ministers in London tried to block the Welsh Trade Union Bill. The Labour Welsh Government argues UK ministers should not impose restrictions on union activity in Wales in devolved services, such as the NHS and schools. The committee report was not supported by one of its eight members as Conservative AM Janet Finch-Saunders did not agree with",

The DA won its best-ever share of the vote in the 2014 elections, but has struggled with perceptions it primarily represents white South Africans. Mr Maimane faced party chairman Wilmot James for the job, and was elected at a party conference in Port Elizabeth. He promised cheering supporters that the DA would win power and lashed out at Mr Zuma over corruption allegations. \"Make no mistake Mr President, you will have your day in court,\" he said in his victory speech. Mr Maimane's predecessor, Helen Zille, made no secret of her belief that the party would never threaten the ANC's enduring grip on power if it could not finally shake off the accusation that it is a \"white\" party,",
    "The comments, which are likely to hike tensions with Beijing, were made by Rex Tillerson at his confirmation hearing. Beijing has been building artificial islands on reefs in waters also claimed by other nations. Images published late last year show military defences on some islands, a think-tank says. Mr Tillerson, appearing before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, likened China's island-building to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. \"We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops and second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.\" China's island-building has caused dismay in the region. Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea, but Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims. In July an international tribunal ruled against Chinese claims, backing a case brought by the Philippines, but Beijing said it would not respect the verdict. The",
    "Silent Majority, painted during the 1998 Glastonbury Festival, shows soldier-like figures landing on a beach with a speaker in an inflatable raft. Its Norfolk owners say it \"depicts the ...rave and hip hop scene of the time\". The work is unusual for a Banksy piece, as it is largely freehand with little use of stencils. Auction house Digard said it was thought to be one of the artist's oldest works. The metal piece, painted over three days outside the festival's Dance Tent, measures 2.4m (7.8ft) by 9.9m (32ft). Its message reads: \"It's better not to rely too much on silent majorities ... for silence is a fragile thing... one loud noise and it's gone.\" The elusive graffiti artist's team has provided a certificate of authenticity as part of the auction lot. It was painted in collaboration with fellow Bristol artist Inkie. The owner, who prefers to be",

He was once a key figure in Sinn F\u00e9in's rise in Northern Ireland politics. The coroner adjourned the inquest until a separate criminal investigation is concluded. The inquest has previously been adjourned at least 19 times. Gardai Superintendent (Supt) Michael Finan told the coroner on Wednesday that a \"continuing, active, significant investigation\" was ongoing. He said an individual who had already appeared before the courts was due back in the Special Criminal Court in October and three arrests had been made in the last four months. Supt Finan said there was a \"continuing fruitful liaison\" with an external police force. The coroner said he believed there had never been so many adjournments in a coroner's court. \"Hopefully, the investigation will have a result and we will get justice",

    "The prime minister raised the subject during talks with US President Barack Obama at the White House. Critics of existing rules say they make the extradition of UK nationals easier as the US authorities have to produce less evidence to support their case. But a senior judge reviewing it in 2011 found it was fair to British citizens. The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Cameron had raised the issue about how extradition rules are operating in practice during two hours of talks at the White House on Wednesday. The prime minister is in the middle on a three-day official visit to the United States. Concerns have been raised about the 2003 US-UK extradition treaty following controversial cases involving British citizens such as Christopher Tappin and Gary McKinnon. Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights are among those who have urged the government to renegotiate the treaty, saying it is unbalanced. Mr Tappin, a retired"
