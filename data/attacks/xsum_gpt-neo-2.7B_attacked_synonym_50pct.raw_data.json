Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns.

When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity.

It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP.

Health will be a central part of the Chancellor George Osborne 's spending review next week - he will set out how the \u00a38bn commitment will be phased in. But since the pledge was made before the election, he and other ministers have been careful to say this extra funding over and above inflation is for the NHS.

It also found schools had more influence than parents in giving confidence in understanding politics. Those aged 16 and 17 were able to vote in the referendum on 18 September, the first UK ballot to include them. Researchers at dpart gathered evidence from two surveys of under 18s - one conducted in April and May 2013, and then a second conducted one year later. More than 1,000 young people responded to each survey. They found under 18s were at least as interested in politics as adults. Only 7% had never talked about the referendum with anyone. Young people were less likely than adults to align themselves with political parties, but the proportion who said they did not feel an affinity to one dropped in the year before the vote, from 57% to 51%. Parents had a strong influence",

The team at Harvard Medical School said the unintended effect was \"disturbing\". Experts said similar changes had been seen in other countries. In 2003, there were concerns about an increased suicide risk from some antidepressants. It led to the US Food and Drug Administration changing the medicine warnings and widespread media reports. However, there was concern that the reports were exaggerated and missed out the benefits of antidepressants. The study, which followed 2.5 million teenagers and young adults between 2000 and 2010, showed an immediate impact of the warnings. Prescriptions fell by a third in teenagers and by a quarter in young adults. The number of suicide attempts increased by 22% in teenagers and 34% in young adults. Overall it led to an additional 77 attempts, the researchers estimated. The report concluded: \"It is disturbing that after the health advisories, warnings and media",

In a statement, the Syrian army said a cessation of hostilities in areas of Eastern Ghouta came into effect on midday local time on Saturday (09:00 GMT). \"The army will retaliate in a suitable manner to any violation,\" it said. Rebel group Faylaq al-Rahman welcomed the pause and urged the government to respect it.

Combined with other plant techniques, the team created drops that grew larger as temperatures increased. The authors say the development could significantly improve water harvesting and electricity generation. A little drop of water may seem insignificant but the physical processes involved in both the formation and movement of the liquid are essential to operation of thermal power plants, desalination and air conditioning systems. Condensation is also critical to the more fundamental function of gathering water for human use in dry climates, a growing, global issue. Researchers have made previous attempts to mimic the remarkable abilities of the Namib beetle, which uses its bumpy shell to draw all the water it needs from periodic, foggy winds in the desert. The assumption until now has been that the surface chemistry of the beetle's back has been the key - but this new study says that",

Controversially, he has also said repeatedly - although not in this speech - that he would build a wall on the southern border that Mexico would pay for, to stop Mexico's criminals and rapists from coming to the US. He also wants to ban Muslims from entering the country in an attempt",

It is understood the rail infrastructure body was refused immediate leave to appeal against the ruling. Network Rail faces potential legal costs running into six figures after losing the case in Cardiff bought by Mr Waistell and a neighbour.

    "The statement contrasted with earlier signals from President Trump that he did not object to settlement activity. But it said he did not see settlements as an \"impediment to peace\" - a departure from previous US positions. The fate of settlements in the occupied West Bank is one of the most contentious issues between Israel and the Palestinians. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Israel's pro-settlement government, which had sharp differences with the Obama administration on the issue, felt emboldened when Donald Trump took office last month. Since then, it has authorised 6,000 new settlement homes, in one of the biggest surges for years.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage has predicted his party could hold the balance of power after May's general election. Mr Clegg also called for an extra \u00c2\u00a31.5bn in NHS funding to be included in Chancellor George Osborne's Autumn Statement next month. The Lib Dems currently have 56 MPs to UKIP's two, but trail Mr Farage's party in the opinion polls and picked up just 349 votes in last week's Rochester and Strood by-election. Asked about the result in his monthly press conference, Mr Clegg said there had been a \"sharp drop in support for all three main Westminster parties\", saying the Lib Dems' decline in vote share was similar to that of Labour and the Conservatives.

He said: \"I had a good moment with the players the day before I came to Istanbul so that was special. Then you see that everyone really appreciated my time there, that was important for me.\" The Netherlands international, who praised the \"very classy\" way in which his transfer was handled by Manchester United chief executive officer Ed Woodward, was unveiled in front of about 10,000 Fenerbahce supporters inside the club's stadium.

The UN refugee agency said on Friday that 25,000 migrants boarded people smugglers' boats from Myanmar and Bangladesh in 2015's first quarter. This was about double the number who left over the same period in 2014. Banjong Pongphon is mayor of Padang Besar, a sub-district in southern Songkhla province where 26 bodies were exhumed from mass graves last week. Smugglers' camps in the forests and plantations surrounding Padang Besar are among the main destinations of the migrants, according to a report by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

But Selby, 32, was off his best against world number 33 in the third round and was never in front until clinching victory with a fine break of 67. \"I was just scraping through. I don't know how I won the game,\" Selby said. \"I thought sooner or later I would come out and start performing, but it didn't seem to happen.\" Selby, famously described as a \"torturer\" by Ronnie O'Sullivan for his ability to grind out wins when not at his best, trailed 2-0, 3-2, 4-3 and 5-4, but showed all his renowned battling ability to pull through at the York Barbican. \"Jamie deserved to win the match,\" Selby admitted. \"He played great, scored two centuries and made more breaks.

Police said the pair were part of a larger group that was plotting the cyber-intrusion into the software giant's systems, seeking to steal customer data.

    "The \"loneliness maps\" could be used to target limited resources at the people and places that need them most. The Hidden Citizens report, published by the Campaign to End Loneliness, said this has already been done successfully in Gloucestershire and Essex. Studies have suggested loneliness contributes to health problems. Laura Alcock-Ferguson, director for the Campaign to End Loneliness, said: \"If local councils and services do not act now to find the people experiencing severe loneliness, we are likely to see the consequences in our hospitals and social care services. \"Loneliness and isolation in older age is a serious public health issue and increases the risk of conditions including dementia, high blood pressure and depression.\" The report, published in conjunction with the University of Kent, describes how Gloucestershire County Council adapted a model used by Essex County Council when creating its own loneliness map.

    "Keeping older people at work can also boost wages for younger employees, argues Ros Altmann, the government-appointed champion for older workers. Her report suggests that extending working lives would add \u00c2\u00a355bn a year to the UK economy. If everyone worked one year longer, it would add 1% to annual GDP, she says. \"Academic and historical evidence shows that, far from damaging job prospects, keeping more older people in work is associated with rising employment and wages for younger people,\" said Dr Altmann, a former adviser to 10 Downing Street. If older people keep working, the theory goes, they have more money to spend, and that boosts the economy, creating more jobs for everyone. Conversely, if older people stop work, there is less money in the economy, so fewer jobs. The idea is well-known to economists as the \"lump of labour fallacy\" - the false belief that the number of jobs in an economy is fixed. If the number of over-50s leaving the workforce continues",

It plans to build new accommodation and education blocks at Cookham Wood, taking its capacity from 131 to 208.

He said: \"A 15 year-old took his own life in the prison. \"There are a succession of inspection reports which have said that this is a prison with which has had major problems. \"There are reports of widespread bullying, physical assault and we don't think it's appropriate to be expanding a prison which has these kind of problems.\"",

The freed girls have been in government custody since their release but were brought home to Chibok for Christmas. But family members told the BBC that the girls were kept in a politician's house and barred from going home. They were also prevented from attending church services with their families. The girls were take to the house of an assembly member in Chibok to be reunited with their parents but weren't allowed to go to their own homes. \"I can't believe my daughter has come this close to home but can't come home,\" said one father. \"There's no point bringing them to Chibok only to be locked in another prison.

HSBC says its service will be offered to up to 15 million banking customers. First Direct's customers will be offered the voice and fingerprint recognition system over the next few weeks, followed by HSBC's in the summer. Francesca McDonagh, HSBC UK's head of retail banking and wealth management, described the change as \"the largest planned rollout of voice biometric security technology in the UK\".

    "The bill aims to revoke parts of the UK government's 2016 Trade Union Act. It would mean current restrictions on industrial action in the NHS, the fire service, schools and other devolved services in Wales would change. UK ministers say industrial relations are a matter for Westminster. A key element of the UK government's law is to only allow strikes backed by 40% of a union's members in a ballot. But members of the Welsh Assembly's Equality, Local Government and Communities Committee agreed the new legislation was needed to maintain Wales' \"social-partnership\" approach. In March, Welsh Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said it would be a \"democratic outrage\" if ministers in London tried to block the Welsh Trade Union Bill. The Labour Welsh Government argues UK ministers should not impose restrictions on union activity in Wales in devolved services, such as the NHS and schools.

Mr Maimane faced party chairman Wilmot James for the job, and was elected at a party conference in Port Elizabeth. He promised cheering supporters that the DA would win power and lashed out at Mr Zuma over corruption allegations. \"Make no mistake Mr President, you will have your day in court,\" he said in his victory speech. Mr Maimane's predecessor, Helen Zille, made no secret of her belief that the party would never threaten the ANC's enduring grip on power if it could not finally shake off the accusation that it is a \"white\" party,",
    "The comments, which are likely to hike tensions with Beijing, were made by Rex Tillerson at his confirmation hearing. Beijing has been building artificial islands on reefs in waters also claimed by other nations. Images published late last year show military defences on some islands, a think-tank says. Mr Tillerson, appearing before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, likened China's island-building to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. \"We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops and second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.\" China's island-building has caused dismay in the region. Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea, but Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims. In July an international tribunal ruled against Chinese claims, backing a case brought by the Philippines, but Beijing said it would not respect the verdict. The",

Its Norfolk owners say it \"depicts the ...rave and hip hop scene of the time\". The work is unusual for a Banksy piece, as it is largely freehand with little use of stencils. Auction house Digard said it was thought to be one of the artist's oldest works. The metal piece, painted over three days outside the festival's Dance Tent, measures 2.4m (7.8ft) by 9.9m (32ft).

He was once a key figure in Sinn F\u00e9in's rise in Northern Ireland politics. The coroner adjourned the inquest until a separate criminal investigation is concluded. The inquest has previously been adjourned at least 19 times. Gardai Superintendent (Supt) Michael Finan told the coroner on Wednesday that a \"continuing, active, significant investigation\" was ongoing. He said an individual who had already appeared before the courts was due back in the Special Criminal Court in October and three arrests had been made in the last four months. Supt Finan said there was a \"continuing fruitful liaison\" with an external police force.

Critics of existing rules say they make the extradition of UK nationals easier as the US authorities have to produce less evidence to support their case. But a senior judge reviewing it in 2011 found it was fair to British citizens. The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Cameron had raised the issue about how extradition rules are operating in practice during two hours of talks at the White House on Wednesday. The prime minister is in the middle on a three-day official visit to the United States. Concerns have been raised about the 2003 US-UK extradition treaty following controversial cases involving British citizens such as Christopher Tappin and Gary McKinnon.
